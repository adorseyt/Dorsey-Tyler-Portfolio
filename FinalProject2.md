# Part II: Building the Story
## Introduction
In this section, I worked to build upon the outline of <a href = "https://adorseyt.github.io/Dorsey-Tyler-Portfolio/FinalProject.html"> Part I: Project Wireframe</a> to create a cohesive story. We were given the option to create a storyboard or work within the final deliverable to create a draft. I opted to work directly on the draft... and may have gotten carried away. What resulted is a first attempt at the presentation - including finalized visualizations, text, and other aesthetic elements. While this may have front-loaded the work towards the final product, it may have reduced the flexibility and openness to feedback, which will be discussed in the user research study. 

What was created is available below:
