# Part II: Building the Story
## Introduction
In this section, I worked to build upon the outline of <a href = "https://adorseyt.github.io/Dorsey-Tyler-Portfolio/FinalProject.html"> Part I: Project Wireframe</a> to create a cohesive story. We were given the option to create a storyboard or work within the final deliverable to create a draft. I opted to work directly on the draft... and may have gotten carried away. What resulted is a first attempt at the presentation - including finalized visualizations, text, and other aesthetic elements. While this may have front-loaded the work towards the final product, it may have reduced the flexibility and openness to feedback, which will be discussed in the user research study. 

## Draft Product
What was created is available here: <a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/mTLdFk9VoVRnOH1p">"The Planet Needs You... To Take Pictures of Bugs"</a>.

## User Research

### User Research Protocol

#### Focusing the Audience
When seeking to define my core audience, I focused on prior knowledge, agency, and want. I'm reaching out to readers who are already well-informed about the evidence behind Anthropogenic climate change and feel strongly about the future of the planet. They may have a background or interest in biology, ecology, conservation, and environmental protection. They fall into two major personas, abstracted here:

<i><b>Clint:</b> Middle-aged. Participated in the environmental movements of the 1960-70's. Enjoys hiking and bird-watching. Studied biology at the university level. Feels angry about the lack of apparent awareness among his friends.

<b>Claire:</b> Millennial. Very in-tune with articles related to climate change, and has modified their behavior to be more green (becoming vegetarian, composting, etc.). Enjoys rock climbing and reading. Studied business at the university level, but listens to podcasts surrounding ecology and environmentalism. Feels overwhelmed about the scope of the problem, but feels a sense of comradery with their peers.
</i>

It should be noted that neither group has explicit interest or prior knowledge in insects specifically. Both "Clint" and "Claire" tend to focus on the big picture of envrionmentalism and conservation, and may find insects creepy or insignificant. 

In terms of agency, I'm focusing on readers who are willing to make personal behavioral changes to their lifestyle, but often feel powerless when solutions are out of their hands. They may contact their representatives and try to restrict purchases from companies that don't align with their ethics, but otherwise feel that many big actors - governments, companies, and populations as a whole - are at a scope that causes them to shut down.

Both Clint and Claire want to feel like their contributions matter. They want to be informed about the reality of the crisis, but don't want a lecture without a solution. They want to feel like they are part of a greater movement, that their small actions combine with others to make actual progress. 

I have selected 4 test audience members to provide feedback from the draft - two that more closely align with the "Clint" persona, and two for "Claire". Both groups have gender diversity. 

### Framing Feeback: Methodology
In order to collect robust and untampered results, I conducted both a survey and interviews with each feedback member. 

The survey was presented as a link, with scale questions respondants could complete as they looked through the presentation, and at the end. I did this because each of the interviewers have a personal relationship with me as an author. They know I'm passionate about this subject, and have heard about my progress as I built out the draft. For this reason, I feel it's difficult to them to provide critical feedback without wanting to be encouraging. Having at least a portion of the response be separated from me should allow more true feedback.

In addition, I drafted guided interview questions that built upon their scores and facilitated more detailed feedback. The following sections will outline the questions posed and the average response where possible.
