# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## Introduction
This exercise follows the critique by design proces, which allows data visualization creators to think about the components of a sucessful design, recieve feedback, and iterate the creation process. In this case, we'll be starting with an existing chart from an outside source. The visualization will be evaluated based on its usefulness, completeness, perceptability, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement. Each componant will be given a score between 0 and 10, with a description of how features impacted each score.

These insights will provide a roadmap for our goals in the redesign. For example, if the original chart feels incomplete what elements should be included to improve it? This will be undertaken in a wireframing exercise, where the designer can brainstorm a number of solutions and reconceptualize the data into the narrative the original author may have intended. Just as the original may benefit from the critique exercise, these prototupes will be subject to peer review - allowing perspectives outside of the author to contribute to the final solution. In the final step, this feedback will be encompassed into a finalized revision of the data visualization. 

## Step 1: Identifying an Existing Data Visualization
For this exercise, I have selected a chart from the <a href="https://www.intracen.org/country/Albania/">International Trade Centre's Country Profile for Albania</a>. The work of ITC was integral to my previous work in understanding Albania's long-term economic strategy, but at the time I had felt the generated visualizations struggled to easily convey information to my end readers. In the end, I opted to describe the takeaways from the data over leveraging the charts themselves. This exercise gave me a wonderful opportunity to ask what I would do with another chance to take this on.

I have chosen to work specifically with ITC's Aid Dependency timeline, which describes how dependent on foreign aid the Albanian economy has been compared to other nations in the region. Here, aid dependency is calculated as how much Official Development Assistance (ODA) the country received as a proportion of their Gross National Income (GNI).

### Discussion
While the core data for this visualization being readily available from the <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org">World Bank World Development Indicators DataBank</a> allowed a recreation of many elements of the visualization, there are aspects of the chart that can not - or perhaps should not - be reproduced. For example, the original chart correctly includes Greece as a neighbor to Albania, the WDI do not have Greece's data for this series. In the original chart, Greece is listed in the key despite not being present in the timeline. I have decided to omit it completely. Conversely, there is a dotted green line that is unidentified in the key and thus cannot be recreated. It will also be omitted.

In addition, there are a number of categories with ambiguous meanings or incorrect nomenclature. There are two ambiguous regional groupings - "ITC Regional Group Average" and "Neighbour's Average". The ITC considers Albania part of their Eastern Europe and Central Asia region, which emcompasses Albania, Bosnia & Herzgovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Serbia, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and the Russian Federation. However, the average data for these nations does not reflect what the original chart outlines. In fear of misrepresenting their intention here, I have decided to omit this grouping. For the Neighbour's Average, I was again unable to recreate the figures presented here, but felt the grouping was useful, so will be presenting it as an average of all nations (excluding Albania) presented in the chart.  What is listed as The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia represents the data of North Macedonia. The WDI has updated their labeling to refer to the nation's 2019 official renaming, but ITC has not. I have opted to use "North Macedonia" to reflect this update.

These data issues will be discussed further in Step 2, but another omission I considered was in the timeline of data presented. This speaks more about the intended narrative that the chart is meant to support, and can be up to interpretation. I believe that ITC's intention is to show the general trajectory of aid dependence for all regions and nations, and such a 2002-2012 10-year period is sufficient. However, I approached this with a focus specifically on Albania, and considered the inclusion of key dates specific to the country and how it would have a more comprehensive narrative. Albania suffered an economic collapse that resulted in a quasi-civil war in 1997. While it may be taking liberties, I also want to explore how this chart can tell that story. What impact did that collapse have on aid and income, and how has Albania's economy reacted compared to other nations who did not have that event? For this reason I will wireframe some ways playing with that idea and not.

## Step 2: Critique

### Usefulness
Is the visualiztion useful to the intended audience? Does it communicate valuable information?

### Completeness
Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?

### Perceptability
Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate? Does it use logical comparisons?

### Truthfulness
Is the visualization accurate, reliable, and valid? Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisons that aren't correct?

### Intuitiveness
Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information? If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instrcutions on how to interpret it?

### Aesthetics
Is it interesting or enjoyable to look at? Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like? Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at? 

### Engagement 
Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic? Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others?
