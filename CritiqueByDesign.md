## Introduction

## Step 1: Identifying an Existing Data Visualization

## Step 2: Critique

### Usefulness
Is the visualiztion useful to the intended audience? Does it communicate valuable information?

### Completeness
Does the visualiztion have everything necessary to make it understandable?

### Perceptability
Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate? Does it use logical comparisons?

### Truthfulness
Is the visualization accurate, reliable, and valid? Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisons that aren't correct?

### Intuitiveness
Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information? If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instrcutions on how to interpret it?


### Aesthetics
Is it interesting or enjoyable to look at? Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like? Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at? 

### Engagement 
Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic? Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others?
