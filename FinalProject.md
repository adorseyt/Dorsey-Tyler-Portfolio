# Final Project Wireframe - "The Planet Needs You to Take Pictures of Bugs"

## Project Summary 
 While my professional passion lies in government infomatics, I’ve aways had a soft spot for bugs. The biodiversity loss during the Anthropocene has received media attention recently, but most ignore the biggest sector of animal life. This presentation will highlight the untold story of insect loss – why it matters, why we know so little, and what we can do to help.

## Project Outline

### Insects are a Major Player in the Story of Biodiversity
- Insecta is by far the biggest class of the animal kingdom.
  - Visualization: By collective mass, insects outweigh humans 17 to 1.
- While there has been focus on bees and butterflies,, beetles and weevils (coleoptera) are the largest order.
  - Visualization: Coleoptera are 40% of all insect species, and 30% of all animal species.
- Even if you don't care about them intrinsically, they're a vital part of the greater ecosystem.
  - Pollination, Food Source, and Waste Recycling.

### Insect Biodiversity Loss is an Untold Story with a Frightening Ending
- Insects aren't getting the same attention as vertebrates.
  - The International Union for Conservation of Nature is the premiere database assessing the vulnerability of species, but their data on insects is severely lacking.
  - Visualization: IUCN described to evaluated rate of vertebrates (mammals 91%, birds 100%, reptiles 87%, amphibians 87%, fishes 63%) compared to insects (1.1%).
