# Final Project Wireframe - "The Planet Needs You to Take Pictures of Bugs"

## Project Summary 
 While my professional passion lies in government infomatics, I’ve aways had a soft spot for bugs. The biodiversity loss during the Anthropocene has received media attention recently, but most ignore the biggest sector of animal life. This presentation will highlight the untold story of insect loss – why it matters, why we know so little, and what we can do to help.

## Project Outline

### Insects are a Major Player in Biodiversity
- Insecta is by far the biggest class of the animal kingdom.
  - Visualization 1: By collective mass, insects outweigh humans 17 to 1.
- While there has been focus on bees and butterflies,, beetles and weevils (coleoptera) are the largest order.
  - Visualization 2: Coleoptera are 40% of all insect species, and 30% of all animal species.
- Even if you don't care about them intrinsically, they're a vital part of the greater ecosystem.
  - Pollination, Food Source, and Waste Recycling.

### Insect Biodiversity Loss is an Untold Story with a Frightening Ending
- Insects aren't getting the same attention as vertebrates.
  - The International Union for Conservation of Nature is the premiere database assessing the vulnerability of species, but their data on insects is severely lacking.
  - Visualization 3: IUCN described to evaluated rate of vertebrates (mammals 91%, birds 100%, reptiles 87%, amphibians 87%, fishes 63%) compared to insects (1.1%). 
- The information we do have paints a grim picture.- Visualization: 19% of assessed insects are threatened, compared to 18% of vertebrates.
 - A study found that insect biomass is declining an estimated 2.5% annually
 - Interactive Visualization 4: 2.5% annual decline means 25% loss in 10 years, 50% loss in 20, and 100% in 40. So when was Year 0?

### What We Don't Know Matters
- We don't understand population areas: for most species we still don't know where they're endemic, so we can't look for signs of fragmentation, a key indicator of species threat.
- We can't be conclusive about causes: while there's a number of theories that hold water, entomologists disagree about the biggest drivers of insect loss.
- We can't be conclusive about effects: we need to know how insect loss is affecting other species.
 - One study found that insectivorous birds are declining while omnivores are remaining stable, but more work is needed to establish the connection with insect loss.
- We can't make policy: without deeper understanding, we cannot set up action items that would be most effective in addressing the problem.

### Entomologists Can't Tackle the Data Problem Alone
- We simply do not have the same manpower as other conservation specialities, takling a much bigger population with much fewer resources.
 - Visualization 5: 928 entolomologists in the U.S. compared to 91,000 known species and 114,000 estimated total species.

### Want to Help? Meet Your Newest Instagram Model
- We can help entomologists and conservation scientists worldwide by identifying existing species, providing essential data to map endemic regions and show trends. 
- By using apps like INaturalist, the public can take geo-tagged pictures of the insects they see in their area. Thousands of volunteers help to identify and catelogue the species, creating a dataset for researchers.

## Data Sources
All base data and their original sources used in this presentation have been compiled <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTwQUSjl-vacpBKPTuvZqmtCZpeB3ypN27cSAP9A1EXoF5qmf0l4KKrlSP3kas5Jq341mdjhrMWH--B/pubhtml">in a publicly-available Google Sheet</a>. 

This presentation relies heavily on the work of IUCN and their <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">Red List of Threatened Species</a>, one of the most comprehensive resources for conservationists worldwide. It also cites the work of Francisco Sanchez-Bayo, who has made it a personal mission to bring insect loss into public attention. His work with Kris A.G. Wyckhuys on the <a href="https://insect-respect.org/fileadmin/images/insect-respect.org/Rueckgang_der_Insekten/2019_Sanchez-Bayo_Wyckhuys_Worldwide_decline_of_the_entomofauna_A_review_of_its_drivers.pdf">Worldwide Decline of Entomofauna</a> compiles field reserach from 73 historical studies to provide a methodology for estimating insect loss. While both sources pose theories for causes of the issue, other publications like Robert R. Dunn's <a href="https://conbio-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.cmu.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00078.x">Modern Insect Extinctions, the Neglected Majority</a> make compelling arguements that further research is needed before drivers can be identified confidently.

Other sources are used to provide context and shed light on the barriers to research. Bar, Phillips, & Milo's <a href = "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/07/13/1711842115.DC1/1711842115.sapp.pdf">The Biomass Distribution on Earth</a> allows us to contextualize insects not just as a taxa, but as a population whose individuals comprise the majority of animal life. Bowler, Heldbjerg, Fox, de Jong, and Bohning-Gaese's <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30912605/">Long-Term Declines of European Insectivorous Bird Populations and Potential Causes</a> will be cited for their contributions to understanding the effects of insect loss on the greater ecology, though their study would need replication for definitive conclusions. <a href = "https://genent.cals.ncsu.edu/insect-identification/order-coleoptera/">NC State University's BugInfo</a> will be used to show the prevalence of Coleoptera, <a href = "https://genent.cals.ncsu.edu/insect-identification/order-coleoptera/">the Smithsonian</a> will outline the scope of species that need to be documented, and employment data aggregator <a href="https://www.zippia.com/entomologist-jobs/demographics/">Zippia's</a> estimate of entolomolgists will speak to the manpower of that work.

## Methods and Mediums
The final presentation will be published with <a href="https://shorthand.com">Shorthand</a>. The final project should be a scrollable information set with a narrative and both static and interactive visualizations.
