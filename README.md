# Dorsey-Tyler-Portfolio
Public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data, showcasing the work performed as part of this course's curriculum. 

# About me
My name is Alea Dorsey-Tyler (she/her or they/them), and I am a Masters candidate for Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I love leveraging technology and analytics to help public service providers streamline their operations so they can focus on helping their communities. 

# What I hope to learn
While I've built a lot of dashboards, I have been asked (more than once) if it's possible that I'm colorblind. I'm very excited to be able to apply good design principles, including color theory. I want my dashboards to be able to help end users get information from data and extrapolate from their own perspectives to bring new ideas.
