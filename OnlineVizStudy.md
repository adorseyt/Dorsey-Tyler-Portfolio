# Online Data Visualization Tools
In this exercise, we leveraged the OECD's record of general debt to GDP ratio for countries where data is readily available. The first two visualizations allow users to compare countries, either for a given year or across a 1995-2019 timespan.

## OECD Data
This bar chart represents the countries' debt as a percentage of their total GDP for the year 2017. The United State's standing is highlighted for easy comparison.

### Snapshot Map
Another way to understand nations' debt is to take a snapshot of a year (2017, as used for the OECD bar chart) and provide a chrolopleth map. In this visulization, countries that had a high debt-to-GDP ratios are shown in red. Countries that were not included in the dataset have been greyed out. Hover any country to see thei debt-toGDP ratio.
