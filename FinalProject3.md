# Creating the Final Publication

After building out a story in <a href = "https://adorseyt.github.io/Dorsey-Tyler-Portfolio/FinalProject.html">Part I</a> and soliciting feedback on a draft in <a href="https://adorseyt.github.io/Dorsey-Tyler-Portfolio/FinalProject2.html">Part II</a>, this section will document the final changes that occured before The Planet Needs You was published. Before this step, I identified three key modifications that were required in the final product:

### Add Citations
The most important change was making sure that readers could connect the information to their original sources and that photos used were appropriately attributed. I created in-text links to many parts of the story, including the number of insect species, the prevalence of Coleoptera, and the origin of the $57 billion estimation of insect contributions to the U.S. In addition, I added a link to the compiled dataset referenced in Part I. Photo attributions appear mostly as captions, but additional photos used for backgraounds or as parts of composite images were attributed below. I'd like to take this moment to give a special shout-out to <a href = "https://www.pexels.com/@ekamelev?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels">Egor Kamelev</a>, whose beautiful photos were used througout.

### Change the Language
My reviewers identified a few areas where they felt the language could be changed to be more accurate. I replaced "climate change and human activity" with "anthropogenic climate change", removed typos and repetitive language with regards to Franciso Sanchez-Bayo's contribution, and removed the dreadded "impact" as a verb. I also takled another action item (though one I categorized as "nice to have") to soften the tone by removing multiple uses of the phrase "The picture is grim". I replaced this with a more explicit representation of the facts, citing John Losey's basis for the $57 billion figure. I appreciated this change as it had the additional benefit of smoothing the transtition between those two sections.

### Modify the Colors
I received feedback from multiple sources that some of the visualizations were hard to discern, or felt out of place, because of their colors. I flipped the "Described vs. Evaluated" chart so that the labels were more clear. I replaced the red in the "Assessed vs. Threatened" chart to a brown that was used throughout the rest of the publication. I also darkened the "New Species" icons in the "Entomologists" visualization, and in doing so identified an error; in the original version, it stated that there were 23,000 new species likely to be identified. Upon reading the original source again, I realized it was actually 73,000. I added icons to reflect this, modified the color scheme, and shaped them to look like they were raining down upon the entomologist. That had been what I was going for originally, but with more dots to work with I think I was able to get a better effect.

### (Additional) Be More Explicit About Contradictions
Some of my reviewers were confused why I said there is insufficient data to identify causes when the Red List lists them out clearly. For this reason, I added language about the debate between conservationists about whether causes can be conclusively identified without more data. I add Robert Dunn's arguements, cited in Part I but not present in Part II's draft, to make this more clear. In addition, I made some cosmetic changes, including reworking the "What we don't know matters" section to change "Identify the Causes/Effects" to "Confirm the Causes" and "Identify the Scope of Effects" respectively to be more precise.

# Discussion

### Audience
My core audience has not been refined or changed much since Part II. It was already rather specific; this is definitely a story that is catered to people who come in with base understanding, passion, and motivation to act around topics of conservation and climate change. While I found that many of my peers focused their story as time went along, I've been (and remained) on the other end of the spectrum; my story may actually be hindered by how restrictive the intended audience is. I have chosen to keep it that way, as I felt that adding the background of why climate change and biodiversity loss matter would have taken away from the core story I wanted to tell. I made this presentation with the specific people in mind - wanting to expand those existing passion to a sector of life they tend to be dismissive of.
